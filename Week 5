1. I plan on speaking with my digital audio professor tomorrow morning about this project and get his input/approval
2. I wrote the abstract for the research convenvtion


I've begun making a list of some things I can look into and planned usability tests, the first one this Wednesday with my partner in class.

I've noticed some things that could be improved in inserts, for example xpand2. The size of the buttons can be larger and that interface could be improved.

In addition, hotkeys provide an embodied technique to using a digital interface. I want to investigate more on how learning things hermeneutically can be translated into 
a form of embodied knowledge, where you may not have an knowledge based understanding of something but your body can remember how to perform the action to get the result you want.

other intuitive features, such as up to increase something and down to decrease something. 

evaluation of symbols 

measuring and asking users how long it takes to get good at digital tools to the point where creating is second nature
