Plan on interviewing someone who composes solely with FLStudio tomorrow, and who has a lot of experience working with Composing.

I haven't had much time last week with multiple final projects, but I am thinking of working on making plug-ins currently in Protools more user
friendly.

My concern is that most of the solutions that would come with working with digital instruments have already been created, such as:
external, connectable MIDI controls/mixing consoles or a mixture of both.

In addition, the main focus of my project would be to simply figure out how digital music could be embodied. 
I want to focus more on what ways a certain interface, based on how it is designed, could inhibit creative work.

I believe with more interviews I can come up with a short paper documenting my knowledge but I'm just unsure of what interfaces I can improve on.

I have some examples that I will bring to the meeting tomorrow.
